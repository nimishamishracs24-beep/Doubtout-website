## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

* Node.js
* npm
* PostgreSQL
* Git

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd DoubtOut
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

If the frontend and backend have separate `package.json` files, install dependencies inside each directory:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

and:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Configure the database

Create a PostgreSQL database for the application and configure the database connection through environment variables.

Example:

```env
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Never commit `.env` files or expose database credentials.

### 4. Start the application

Start the backend:

```bash
npm start
```

For development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then start the frontend according to the repository's configured scripts.
